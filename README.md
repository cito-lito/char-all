# charity-all

### Idea
- User want to make a donation but cant decide to whom.
- User Input: A donor sends Funds to the contract.
- The contract automatically divides and transfers the funds to a list of pre-verified charity addresses.(ideally using effective altruism)
- Verified Recipients: Only pre-approved charity associations receive donations.
- PoC Status: not working yet :D
